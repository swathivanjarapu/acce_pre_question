# Given the names and grades for each student in a class of  students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

# Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

# Example

# The ordered list of scores is , so the second lowest score is . There are two students with that score: . Ordered alphabetically, the names are printed as:

# alpha



# m=[]
# s=[]
# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     for _ in range(int(input())):
#         name = input()
#         score = float(input())
#         m +=[[name,score]]
#         s+=[score]
#     x=sorted(set(s))[1]
#     for i,j in sorted(m):
#         if j==x:
#             print(i)
